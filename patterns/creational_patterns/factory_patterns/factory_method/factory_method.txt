All factory patterns encapsulate object creation.
The Factory Method Pattern encapsulates object creation
by letting subclasses decide what objects to create.

we have the creator class(in our case PizzaStore) which has
defined a factory_method(create_pizza) which has no implementation
in the original creator class but is overwritten by the specific
subclasses, according to the need.

Often the creator class(PizzaStore) contains code that is dependent
on the object that is produced by
the subclass(in our case the order_pizza method). The creator class
never really knows which concrete object was created.

The classes that produce the products(pizzas in our case) are called
concrete creators(NewYorkPizzaStore, ChicagoPizzaStore).
