The simple factory is not a pattern, it is more like an idiom,
however it is used quite often and worth mentioning.
Basically we encapsulate the object creation from our client
code to a new class(The factory).

It may seem to be unnecessary to extract that part,
however in case when we have to create a specific pizza in many
places, having that encapsulated in one class reduces the
modification complexity and potential risks.

The examples are inspired by:
